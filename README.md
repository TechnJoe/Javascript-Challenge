JavaScript Homework - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

Background:

WAKE UP SHEEPLE! The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at ALIENS-R-REAL have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.
There is just one tiny problem though... our collection is too large to search through manually. Even our most dedicated followers are complaining that they are having trouble locating specific reports in this mess.

Project:
 Write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset  provided. Also allow the users to filter the table data for specific values. Use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js for thi project.
 
Task:

Create a new repository for this project called javascript-challenge.


Clone the new repository to your computer.


Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Javascript challenge. Use the folder names to correspond to the challenges: UFO-level-1 and UFO-level-2.


Add the html files, static and javascript folders to this folder. This will be the main script to run for analysis.


Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required)


Create a basic HTML web page.


Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to a web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

Make columns for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment.


Use a date form in  HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.

Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional)


Complete all of Level 1 criteria.


Using multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns, write JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

1.date/time
2.city
3.state
4.country
5.shape
